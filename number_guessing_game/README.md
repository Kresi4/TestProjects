# Number Guessing Game

This project is a simple Python game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

## How the Game Works

1. The player enters the start and end of the range.
2. The program generates a random number within this range.
3. The player has a limited number of attempts (calculated based on the range size) to guess the number.
4. After each guess, the program tells the player if the guess was too high or too low.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Run the game with:
   ```bash
      python number_guessing_game/main.py
    ```

## Requirements
